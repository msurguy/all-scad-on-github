List of all OpenSCAD files on github

Reinventing the wheel in SCAD is not necessary. I was wondering if I could find all SCAD files available on Github and using BigQuery made this process really quick. 

Created with Google BigQuery (read about more data mining with Github and public data: https://medium.com/google-cloud/github-on-bigquery-analyze-all-the-code-b3576fd2b150)

Ideas: you can use the same methods to download all Arduino, Eagle or KiCad designs on Github as well, or any other parametric files.

Enjoy!
